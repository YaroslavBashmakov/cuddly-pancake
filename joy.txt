When routine bites hard
And ambitions are low
And resentment rides high
But emotions won't grow
And we're changing our ways
Taking different roads

[Chorus]
Then love, love will tear us apart again
Love, love will tear us apart again

You cry out in your sleep
All my failings exposed
There's a taste in my mouth
As desperation takes hold
Is it something so good
Just can't function no more?
You cry out in your sleep
All my failings exposed
There's a taste in my mouth
As desperation takes hold
Is it something so good
Just can't function no more?

[Chorus]
But love, love will tear us apart again
Love, love will tear us apart again
Then love, love will tear it apart again
Love, love will tear it apart again
новая строка
novaja stroka v pesne
